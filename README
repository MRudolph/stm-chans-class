Type classes for stm-chans package
=================================

This library includes common type classes for the data types from the 
stm and stm-chans package.

Currently there are functions for the following concerns:

Queue
-----

The Queue class contains functions which are common to all queues.
To keep this library as simple as possible, it doesn't take into 
account special cases like unwrapping Maybe-values from closable 
Streams. To handle this cases, it has type parameters for reading and 
writing data, which are functional dependend on the queue-type.

The defined instances are for TQueue,TMQueue,TBQueue and TBMQueue.


ClosableQueue
-------------

This class provides methods for closing queues and checking if they 
are closed.

There are definitions for TMQueue and TBMQueue
